Old project I made when I just started learning react.
I used mostly react and SASS to create this website and its main 
objective was to create a functioning UI for a job seeking website.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm json_server`

Runs a local json server on port 8080 in order to fetch the mockup data from the data folder.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
